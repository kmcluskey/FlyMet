      <h6>This page contains a collection of terms relevant to the project and found throughout the site.</h6>
  <div class="p-4">
  <h6>Mass Spectroscopy</h6>
  <ul class="padded_list">
    <li><u>Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS):</u> An analytical technique where compounds are separated by liquid
chromatography before detection using a mass spectrometer.</li>
    <li><u>Retention Time (RT):</u> The time taken for a metabolite/compound to elute from the chromatographic medium.
      RT is used to enhance a detected metabolite's annotation and identification by comparison to the RT of a known standard.</li>
    <li><u>m/z:</u> Mass spectrometers rely on ionisation of compounds to detect them. Due to the effect of the electric fields used
      in mass spectrometry, compounds with a charge of greater than one act like they have half the mass,
      and therefore the detection scale is related to mass to charge ratio (m/z) rather than mass.
      Mass-to-charge-ratio values measured by the mass spectrometer.</li>
    <li><u>MS Peak:</u> The mass-spectrum represented in two dimensions by the m/z vs the signal intensity of a compound.</li>
    <li><u>Signal Intensity (SI):</u> Arbitrary units describing the peak height of a compound. As different molecules have different susceptibilities to ionisation, the
height of the mass-spec peak is not directly indicative of the abundance of
a compound. </li>
  </ul>


  <hr class="my-4">
  <h6>Metabolomics</h6>
  <ul class="padded_list">
        <li class="pb-1"><u>Metabolism</u> The chemical reactions (or metabolic processes) that are involved in maintaining the stasis of the cell.</li>
        <li><u>Metabolite:</u> The small-molecule substrates, intermediates and products (compounds) of an organismâ€™s metabolism.</li>
        <li><u>Metabolome:</u> The collection of metabolites found in an organism, biofluid or tissue.</li>
        <li><u>Metabolomics:</u> Comprehensive metabolite profiling of a system (cell, tissue, organism), which
          allows the unique chemical fingerprint (of small molecular compounds) that a
          metabolic process leaves behind, to be investigated.</li>
        <li><u>Metabolite Identification:</u> Where the chemical identity of an MS peak is obtained
        from appropriate local reference material such as authentic chemical
        standards using both RT and m/z.</li>
        <li><u>Metabolite Annotation:</u> Where the chemical identity of an MS peak is assigned based solely on matching m/z to
          compounds in a database (e.g. KEGG, HMDB, LipidMaps). As the annotation is based solely on mass,
          a single MS Peak can be annotated as numerous compounds and a single compound can be
          annotated as several different MS peaks.</li>
        <li><u>Fragmentation Analysis:</u> Where the intact compound (that gives rise to the parent m/z) is dissociated
          into sub structures. Here, two parent ions of similar/identical masses (e.g. isomers;
          same chemical formula, different arrangement of atoms) may fragment
          differently depending on their chemical structures. This MS/MS peak
         fragmentation pattern can be searched against mass spectral databases to give confidence to (or dismiss) a peak/compound annotation</li>
    </ul>

  <hr class="my-4">
  <h6><i>Drosophila</i></h6>
  <ul>
    <li><u><i>Drosophila:</i></u> The fruit fly, commonly used as a model organism for study of genetics and development.</li>
  </ul>
