    <h6 id ="gp">General Dissection Protocol</h6>
    <p class="p-4">
      Precool a 2.0 ml screw-cap tube in an ethanol-dry ice bath and carry out the dissections in cooled PBS.
      Flies/larvae were anesthetized by placing them on ice and the dissection dish was kept on ice throughout
      the procedure. Quickly dissect a small number of flies/larvae and transfer to the precooled tube in the
      ethanol-dry ice bath. At the end of the process store the dissected tissues were in the tube at -80 C.
      </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <h6 id ="AAG">Adult Accessory Gland</h6>
    <p class="p-4">
      To dissect the accessory glands, initially remove the thorax from the abdomen and gently cut open the
      abdomen with forceps. Subsequently, remove the testes and accessory glands from the abdomen and the
      testes from the accessory glands. Finally, collect the accessory glands and place them into the
      precooled 2.0 ml tube in an ethanol-dry ice bath.

      </p>
    <hr class="my-4">

  <h6 id ="ABr">Adult Brain</h6>
  <p  class="p-4">
   To dissect the adult brain initially remove the abdomen from the body of the fly and with the dorsal side of
   the thorax against the dissecting dish, remove the proboscis from rest of the head. With the opening
   generated, place forceps on either side of the head (NOT on the eye) near the antenna and gently pull the
   head capsule from the body (hopefully exposing the brain). Separate the brain from the thoracic-abdominal
   ganglion. If the brain remains in the head capsule, carefully pull open the capsule to expose the brain.
   Finally, collect the brain and place it into the pre-cooled 2.0 ml tube in an ethanol-dry ice bath.

    </p>
  <hr class="my-4">

  <h6 id ="LBr">Larval Brain</h6>
  <p class="p-4">
  To dissect the larval brain, hold the larva about two-thirds of the way down from the mouth with forceps.
  Grab and pull the mouthpieces with another set of forceps, the brain and imaginal discs will separate from
  the rest of the larva. Remove the imaginal discs and any other gross tissue as these are potential contaminants.
  Finally, collect the brain and place them into the pre-cooled 2.0 ml tube in an ethanol-dry ice bath.

    </p>
  <hr class="my-4">

    <h6 id ="ACa">Adult Carcass</h6>
    <p  class="p-4">
      To dissect the adult carcass, remove the head, legs and wings from the body of the fly. Discard the head
      and collect the legs and wings. Next, remove the abdomen and with the dorsal side against the dissecting
      dish and gently cut open the abdomen towards the genital region to open it up. Remove the digestive system
      and reproductive system and as much of the trachea as possible. Scrape the cuticle with the forceps to remove
      the fat body, heart, nephrocytes and trachea. Collect the cuticle. Open the thorax and remove as much of the
      muscle and other tissue. Collect the thoractic cuticle. There will be contamination from the tissues
      closely associated with the cuticle.

      </p>
    <hr class="my-4">

    <h6 id ="LCa">Larval Carcass</h6>
    <p class="p-4">
        To dissect the larval carcass, gently tear an opening in the larva near the spiracles. Using this opening,
        cut down the cuticle with forceps towards the mouthpieces, gaining access to the larval organs. Remove the
        fat body and then the digestive system with the tubules attached. Scrape the cuticle to remove associated
        tissues. There will be contamination from the tissues closely associated with the cuticle
      </p>
    <hr class="my-4">


    <h6 id ="ACr">Adult Crop</h6>
    <p class="p-4">
      To dissect the adult crop, initially remove the head from the fly and gently separate the abdomen
      from the thorax. Grab the flyâ€™s genital region and pull gently to separate the digestive system from
      rest of the fly. With care, remove the fore/midgut with the crop still attached and cut away the crop
      from the gut (try to ensure the foregut is not included). Finally, collect the crop and place it on ice
      </p>
    <hr class="my-4">

    <h6 id ="AEy">Adult Eye</h6>
    <p class="p-4">

    To dissect the adult eyes, initially remove the abdomen from the rest of the body. With the dorsal side of
    the thorax placed against the dissecting dish, remove the proboscis. Next, place forceps on either side
    of the head (NOT on the eye) near the antenna and gently pull the head capsule off the body. Once the head
    capsule removed, carefully remove the eyes by gently cutting them out and place them into the pre-cooled 2.0 ml
    tube in an ethanol-dry ice bath. Potential contaminants are from cuticle, antenna, and fat.
      </p>
    <hr class="my-4">

    <h6 id ="AFB">Adult Fat Body</h6>
    <p class="p-4">
    To dissect the adult fat body, initially remove abdomen from rest of body. Then, using forceps,
    grip the genital region and pull to remove the digestive and reproductive systems. With the
    dorsal side of the abdomen against the dissecting dish, gently cut open the abdomen towards
    the genital region to open the abdomen up. Remove any remaining parts of digestive and
    reproductive systems and as much of the trachea as possible. Collect the fat body and place them
    into the pre-cooled 2.0 ml tube in an ethanol-dry ice bath. It can be helpful to break each segment
    from the main part of the abdomen to expose the fat body better. Try to avoid the heart, trachea, and
    nephrocytes as they are potential contaminants of fat body samples
      </p>
    <hr class="my-4">

    <h6 id ="LFB">Larval Fat Body</h6>
    <p class="p-4">
    To dissect the larval fat body initially grab the larva by the mouth hooks.
    Gently pull on the mouth hooks to generate a hole/opening and carefully cut the cuticle open with forceps.
    Take out the fat body and remove the gonads, collecting the remaining fat body and
    place it into the pre-cooled 2.0 ml tube in an ethanol-dry ice bath.
      </p>
    <hr class="my-4">

    <h6 id ="AHead">Adult Head</h6>
    <p class="p-4">
    To dissect the adult head, gently pull the head away from the body with forceps in one hand
    while holding the body with another set of forceps. Collect the head and place it into the
    precooled 2.0 ml tube in an ethanol-dry ice bath. The head samples also contain the eyes and brain.

      </p>
    <hr class="my-4">

    <h6 id ="AHeart">Adult Heart</h6>
    <p class="p-4">
      To dissect the adult heart, initially remove abdomen from rest of body.  Then, using forceps,
      grip the genital region and pull to remove the digestive and reproductive systems.
      With the dorsal side of the abdomen against the dissecting dish, gently cut open the abdomen towards the
      genital region to open the abdomen up.  Remove any remaining parts of the digestive system, reproductive system,
      and as much of the trachea and fat body as possible. The heart is tube running down the dorsal side of the
      abdomen â€“ the fat body extends from the heart so be gentle when
      removing the fat body. Collect the heart and place it into a
      precooled 2.0 ml tube in an ethanol-dry ice bath. There will be potential contamination from the fat
      body and nephrocytes.
