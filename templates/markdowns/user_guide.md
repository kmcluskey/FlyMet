### <a name="overview">Overview</a>

FlyMet is a web-based metabolomics atlas that provides user-friendly visualization of metabolite profiles across *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit-fly) tissues. It is a collaboration between the Universities of Glasgow (Dow lab (link) and Glasgow Polyomics (link)) and the University of Edinburgh (Burgess lab (link)). To obtain the data for FlyMet, 20 separate reference tissues were obtained by micro-dissection of adult (male (M) and female (F)) and larval *Drosophila* and individual metabolomes were collected for each, using LC/MS.

FlyMet aims to present this data in a user-friendly and transparent manner. Users can search for individual metabolites found in *Drosophila* and examine how these are related to each other Reactome metabolic pathways. In addition, annotated MS peak intensity data is also made available. The peak intensities in the various tissues can be  compared to those found in whole flies or between F/M flies.

Users can search for **individual** metabolites and pathways from the FlyMet Home Page as well as view the **comprehensive** datasets for MS peaks, metabolites and pathways using the Peak, Metabolite and Pathway Explorer pages, respectively.  


FlyMet is a free resource and we are happy to receive feedback/ideas.

#### <a name="nav_bar">Navigation Bar</a>

The Navigation bar at the top of all the FlyMet pages, contains links to the Explorer pages and to the Home page. The Home page can be reached from the *Home* link and also by clicking on the FlyMet logo.

### <a name="home_page">FlyMet Home Page</a>

To search for an individual **Metabolite** or **Pathway** of interest, simply select the appropriate tab, start typing in the search box and choose from the dropdown list.

##### <a name="metabolite_search">Metabolite Search </a>

The metabolite search function provides details of metabolites that have been annotated with a reasonably high level of confidence (using a standard compound library or MS2 data).

###### The results of the metabolite search provides:

1. A table showing how the metabolite (peak intensity) changes in the different tissues compared to its abundance in the whole fly, separated into M/F/L.

  - **Click on a column** (F/M or L) to order the tissues by an abundance or deficit of the chosen metabolite in F, M or L *Drosophila*.
  - **Click on row** (tissue-type), to view the associated intensity data a drilldown chart for each of the individual LC-MS samples collected.


2. Information about the chosen metabolite in the RHS panel.

  - **Click on the name of the metabolite** to reveal database cross-references for the metabolite.


3. A list of the Reactome metabolic pathways, containing the metabolite.

  - Next on the to-do list
  - Links to the pathways and pathway Blurbs from Reactome should be available


##### <a name="pathway_search">Pathway Search </a>

The Pathway search function allows users to search for a Reactome (link) metabolic pathway found in *Drosophila*. Begin by choosing the Pathway tab from the FlyMet Home Page (link).

To search for an individual pathway start by typing its name into the pathway search box and select from the drop-down list.

The results of this search provide:

1. A list of metabolites found in FlyMet that are associated with the chosen pathway.
2. All of the peaks associated with the metabolites found in that pathway.
