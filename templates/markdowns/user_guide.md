### <a name="overview">Overview</a>

FlyMet is a web-based metabolomics atlas that provides user-friendly visualization of metabolite profiles across *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit-fly) tissues.

Flymet tissues were obtained by micro-dissection of adult (male and female) and larval flies (link) and individual metabolomes (link) collected for each using LC/MS (link). FlyMet is a collaboration between the Universities of Glasgow (Dow lab (link) and Glasgow Polyomics (link)) and the University of Edinburgh (Burgess lab (link)).

Can have a link to the <About> page from here. Drosophila, metabolites, tissues, pathways, reactions and links (eventually) to genes.


Users can search for **individual** metabolites and pathways from the FlyMet Home Page as well as **comprehensive** datasets for MS peaks, metabolites and pathways using the Peak, Metabolite and Pathway Explorer pages, respectively.  


Free resource and looking for feedback.
#### <a name="nav_bar">Navigation Bar</a>

From the Navigation Bar at the top of all of the FlyMet pages, the home page can be reached from the *Home* link and also from clicking of the *FlyMet Logo*.  

---

### <a name="home_page">FlyMet Home Page</a>

Search for individual **Metabolites** or **Pathways** by pressing the tabs and choosing from the dropdown lists provided.

Video of the home page and all of the places it can be accessed from.

Point out access to the Explorer pages on the top Nav Bar (link, link, link)



##### <a name="metabolite_search">Metabolite Search </a>

The metabolite search function provides details of  metabolites that have been annotated with a reasonably high level of confidence (using a standard compound library or MS2 data).

To search for a metabolite start by typing its name into the metabolite search box and select from the drop-down list.

###### The results of the metabolite search provides:

1. A table showing the fold-change in metabolite (peak) intensity between the tissue and whole fly data for male, female and larvae flies.

2. By clicking on a column the tissues can be ordered by an abundance or deficit of the chosen metabolite in the selected tissue.

2. By clicking on a tissue-type in the table, the user can view the related peak intensity data as a drilldown chart.

##### <a name="pathway_search">Pathway Search </a>

The Pathway search function allows users to search for a Reactome (link) metabolic pathway found in *Drosophila*. Begin by choosing the Pathway tab from the FlyMet Home Page (link).

To search for an individual pathway start by typing its name into the pathway search box and select from the drop-down list.

The results of this search provide:

1. A list of metabolites found in FlyMet that are associated with the chosen pathway.
2. All of the peaks associated with the metabolites found in that pathway.
